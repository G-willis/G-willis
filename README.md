#INRO

-Hi I'm Godwill aspiring penetration tester and community oral health student based in Kenya. I'm learning Python, Kali Linux, and practical pentesting skills (recon, web app testing, and privilege escalation). This profile showcases my learning progress, projects, and write-ups as I build toward a career in offensive security.

#GOAL

-Become a skilled junior penetration tester focused on web app and network security. I want to document my learning journey, publish safe, reproducible tools and write-ups, and build a portfolio that employers can trust.

#CURRENT FOCUS

- Reconnaissance & scanning (Nmap, Zenmap, OSINT tools)

#SKILLS AND TOOLS

**Languages:** Python (learning)  
**OS:** Kali Linux  
**Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite (learning), Metasploit (basic), Git/GitHub  
**Other:** OSINT techniques (crt.sh, Shodan basics)


#FEATURED REPOS

- **ctf-writeups** — Step-by-step, sanitized write-ups for TryHackMe and beginner CTF boxes. Each writeup includes commands, reasoning, and lessons learned.
- **recon-scripts** — Small, well-documented Python/Bash scripts for subdomain enumeration and nmap automation. Tests & usage examples included.
- **pentest-notes** — Cheatsheets: Nmap commands, privilege-escalation checklists, OWASP summaries.
- **portfolio-site** — Simple GitHub Pages site that lists projects and links to writeups.

#LEARNING LOGS (example entries)

- 2025-10-01 — Completed TryHackMe: Recon-101 (writeup added)  
- 2025-10-07 — Built `enum_subs.py` to query crt.sh and save results
