#INRO

-Hi I'm Godwill aspiring penetration tester and community oral health student based in Kenya. I'm learning Python, Kali Linux, and practical pentesting skills (recon, web app testing, and privilege escalation). This profile showcases my learning progress, projects, and write-ups as I build toward a career in offensive security.

#GOAL

-Become a skilled junior penetration tester focused on web app and network security. I want to document my learning journey, publish safe, reproducible tools and write-ups, and build a portfolio that employers can trust.

#CURRENT FOCUS

- Reconnaissance & scanning (Nmap, Zenmap, OSINT tools)

#SKILLS AND TOOLS

Languages: Python (learning)  
OS:Kali Linux  
Tools: Nmap, Burp Suite (learning), Metasploit (basic), Git/GitHub  
Other: OSINT techniques (crt.sh, Shodan basics)


#FEATURED REPOS

Here are some of my key repositories that show my learning and growth in cybersecurity and ethical hacking:

- [Recon-Tools-Practice](https://github.com/G-willis/Recon-Tools-Practice) — My notes and small projects while learning Nmap, Nikto, and other reconnaissance tools.
- [Python-for-Cybersecurity](https://github.com/G-willis/Python-for-Cybersecurity) — Scripts I’m building as I learn Python for pentesting.
- [CTF-Writeups](https://github.com/G-willis/CTF-Writeups) — My Capture The Flag writeups and solutions from TryHackMe or Hack The Box labs.

#LEARNING LOGS (example entries)

I document my cybersecurity learning journey every week to track my progress:

- October 2025: Focused on GitHub setup, understanding Git, and building my profile README.  
- November 2025: Starting deeper reconnaissance practice — mastering Nmap, whois, nslookup, and OSINT tools.  
- December 2025: Plan to begin vulnerability scanning and exploit research. 

# HOW I DOCUMENT MY WORK

I believe in learning by doing — and writing everything down.  
Here’s how I organize my process:

- I take notes in Notion and Markdown files.
- Each topic (like Nmap, Metasploit, etc.) gets its own folder in a repo.
- I share summaries and key takeaways here on GitHub so others can learn too.
